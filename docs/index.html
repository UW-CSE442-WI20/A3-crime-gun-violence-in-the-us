					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Crime numbers in Los Angeles remain relatively stable throughout 2010 - 2016, with a noticable dip in 2017. We belive this is because data
							collection is not complete in this year</li>
						<li>Theft accounts for the biggest share of crime every single year from 2010 - 2017 and burglary #2</li>
						<li>Fraud replaced Battery as the third most common crime in 2012, which is then replaced by Assault in 2014</li>
						<li>Fraud had a significant decrease in 2017, placing 6th</li>
						<li>Generally, crime rate drops every year from 2010 - 2015 and rising again starting in 2016</li>
						<li>Northern and Eastern districts have relatively less crime than those in the west (near the Calfornia Coast)</li>
						<li>The 77th Street District has the highest number of total crimes at 13781</li>
						<li>Central District has the least number of crimes at 6462</li>
						<li>Crime rate in 2017 dropped by 28% compared to 2010</li>

							<h2>Rationale for design decisions</h2>
							<br>
							<text>At the start of the project,  we were deciding whether to highlight crimes in Los Angeles or gun violence in the United States. We eventually
								settled for crimes in LA because it is a dataset that one of the member used before for a previous assignment and it is more focused in scope.
								* We want to show a map in our graph because that would more clearly display LA and viewers would have a better understanding of the difference
								of crime rates between various districts. We also decided to make a heatmap to show how many crimes occured in that district with green to red 
								coloring (this is inline with our belief that green signals "safety" and red signals "danger"). Each district would also have a tooltip showing the
								total number of crime in that district
								* When deciding a graph for the various crime types in each district, we were deciding between a pie chart and a bar chart. In the end, we chose
								the bar chart because we want to show the number of crimes in each district instead of percentages of crime relative to the district. In this case,
								the bar chart would make more sense. Each bar in the bar chart would also have a tooltip showing the exact number of times this crime happened.
								* We decided to make a slider. This is the most interactive part of our project. User would put the slider in a certain year. Depending on whether
								a district is chosen, it would show the evolution of crimes in the whole LA (if no district is chosen) or a certain district (if a district is chosen)
								The bar would move around: the crime with the highest number of occurences would float to the very top and crimes that are too small to show within
								the current scale would be deleted for visual asthetics

							<h2>Overview of development process</h2>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>We first brainstormed ideas for the project and what datasets to use.</li>
								<li>We then decided on the story we want to tell, the types of graphs we want to show, and division of work</li>
								<li>We made basic functionalities work using a template available online</li>
								<li>We parsed and cleaned our data, with the data team supplying data forms (which columns to use to include, ...) that the front end team needs</li>
								<li>We connected the d3.js with our data and made basic functionalities work</li>
								<li>We refined details of our work (making sure objects doesn't overlap with each other, clear out visual bugs, choose better coloring and placement)</li>
								<li>Prototype testing with friends and fix details which they were confused about</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Work Division</h2>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Yin Yin Low	: Team Lead and Front End & Back End work (CSS, Map, heatmap)</li>
								<li>Sherry Prawiro	: Front end & Back End work (Data parsing and connecting within D3, bar chart, html positioning, general debugging)</li>
								<li>Jessica Zhu	: Front end (Slider, Tooltips, Bar Chart draft and revise, Work-log)</li>
								<li>Jonathan Jusuf	: Back end (Data parsing and cleaning)</li>
								<li>Aditya Jhamb	: Front end (Clear)</li>

							<h2>Commentary</h2><br>
							<h3>Back End</h3><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Hardest part was deciding which program is easier to parse our data. We tried Tableau Prep and MySQL and ended up with Pandas.
									After that, it was studying and figuring out Pandas to clean our data.</li>
								<li>Connecting the data to the chart was tricky, reshaping and preparing the data</li>
								<li>Since the two charts are connected along with the year slider, it was tricky to filter the data based on many conditions and filters</li>
							</ul><br>
							<h3>Front End</h3><br>
							<ul>
								<li>We experienced a hard dedugging time in adding tooltips on the bar chart because the bar chart is animated.</li>
								<li>A lot of bugs and edge cases with display (with coloring, size of bars, title, tooltips, etc), since many of them are connected to each other.</li>
							</ul>
